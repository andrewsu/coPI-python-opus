# Admin Dashboard Specification

## Overview

A read-only admin dashboard for monitoring platform activity and inspecting data. Accessible only to users with `is_admin = true` at `/admin`. Server-rendered with Jinja2 templates, minimal styling using Tailwind.

## Access Control

- All `/admin/*` routes check `is_admin` on the session user. Non-admins get a 403.
- The admin link is only shown in the nav for admin users.
- `is_admin` is set via CLI only — no self-service admin promotion.

**Run Detail (`/admin/activity/{run_id}`):**

Per-run breakdown:

*Messages by channel* — table: channel name, message count, which agents participated

*Channels created this run* — table: channel name, type (thematic/collaboration), created by agent, archived (yes/no)

*Message timeline* — ordered list of all messages: timestamp, agent, channel, first 100 chars of message

### 5. Agents (`/admin/agents`)

Manage agent registrations and lifecycle.

**Sections:**
- **Pending agents** — requests awaiting admin approval. Actions: approve, reject.
- **Active agents** — currently active agents with Slack connection status
- **Suspended agents** — agents that have been suspended

- Outcome (proposal, no proposal, timeout)
- Summary text (truncated)

**Filters:**

### 7. LLM Call Logs (`/admin/llm-calls`)

Debugging view for all LLM API calls.

**Columns:**
- Timestamp
- Agent ID
- Phase
- Model
- Input/output tokens
- Latency (ms)
- System prompt and response (expandable)

### 8. User Impersonation

Admins can assume the identity of any user to see the app as they see it.

**Entry point:** ORCID text input + "Go" button in admin header, available on all `/admin/*` pages.

**Flow:**
1. Admin enters ORCID, clicks Go
2. `POST /api/admin/impersonate` validates ORCID, looks up user, sets `copi-impersonate` httpOnly cookie
3. If ORCID doesn't exist, fetch from ORCID public API and create a User record (unclaimed)
4. Admin is redirected to `/` and sees the app as that user
5. Amber banner at top of every page: "Impersonating [Name] (ORCID)" with "Stop Impersonating" button
6. Stop calls `DELETE /api/admin/impersonate`, clears cookie, redirects to `/admin`

**Implementation:**
- `copi-impersonate` cookie stores target user's database ID
- Session middleware checks this cookie; if present and session user has `is_admin`, overrides session user identity
- Cookie expires after 24 hours, httpOnly, secure in production, sameSite=lax

## API Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /admin/users` | Users overview |
| `GET /admin/users/{id}` | User detail |
| `GET /admin/jobs` | Job queue |
| `GET /admin/activity` | Agent activity overview |
| `GET /admin/activity/{run_id}` | Simulation run detail |
| `GET /admin/agents` | Agent registry management |
| `POST /admin/agents/{id}/approve` | Approve pending agent |
| `GET /admin/discussions` | Thread discussions and outcomes |
| `GET /admin/discussions/export` | Export discussions (HTML/text) |
| `POST /admin/impersonate` | Start impersonating a user |
| `POST /admin/impersonate/stop` | Stop impersonating |

## Design Principles

- **Read-only.** No edit/delete/trigger actions in v1 (except impersonation). Admin actions stay in CLI.
- **Server-rendered.** Jinja2 templates, no client-side data fetching.
- **Minimal styling.** Tailwind. Tables, basic badges. No charts library — just numbers and text.
- **No pagination in v1.** For pilot scale, load all data. Add pagination later.
